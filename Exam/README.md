1. The main difference lies in the fact that observational data is an approximation of reality, shaped by our methods, tools, and perspectives,and it can subject to biases and error, while reality itself is the full, objective truth, which may not always be fully captured by our observations due to limitations.
2. In data visualization, Aesthetics are visual elements that help communicate the data effectively which make the data more understandable and insightful. In data science they may include as color, size, shape, position, line style, text, and more.  From my understanding, the car=reful selection and combination of these aesthetics help make data easier to understand, more engaging, and clearer for the viewer.  
3. The second color pallete and this is the individuals colors are very didtinct from each other, hence it will be nore effective in visualisation.
4. the following are the color scales as depicted the questions:  
   + Qualitative color scale 
   + Sequential color scale
   + Diverging color scale
   + Accent color scale
5. Below are my responses to the validity of the statements:
+ "This person is breathing. = This person is inhaling and exhaling." – Invalid, as breathing is broaderor beyond than just inhaling and exhaling.  
+ "This person is breathing. ≡ This person is inhaling and exhaling." – Valid, as breathing typically involves both inhaling and exhaling.  
+ "This person is conscious. ≡ This person is breathing." – Invalid, as a person can be unconscious yet still breathe ( this is medically proven).  
+ "This person is conscious. = This person is breathing." – Invalid, as consciousness and breathing are not directly equivalent.  
+ "It is rainy. ≡ The sky is cloudy." – Invalid, as rain and cloudiness are not logically equivalent.  
+ "It is rainy. = The sky is cloudy." – Invalid, as rain does not always require clouds.
6. The three pillars of science are Theory, experiment, and computation+data
7. No logical implication does not imply physical caustaion.As one night imply.Example: (logical implication does not necessarily imply physical causation)
A: "It is raining."
B: "The streets are/ is wet "
A ⇒ B: "If it is raining, then the streets are wet."This is logically true in many common situations, because when it rains, the streets often get wet. Rain is a common cause of wet streets.
B ⇒ A: "If the streets are wet, then it must be raining." This is not necessarily true. The streets could be wet for reasons other than rain. Hence The wetness of the streets (B) could have many causes besides rain (A), such as washing the streets, a burst water pipe, or any number of other factors. While A ⇒ B might hold logically (because rain often leads to wet streets), it doesn’t imply that A (rain) is the cause of B (wet streets), as there are many other potential causes for the wetness. This shows that logical implication does not always equate to physical causation.
8. a) It isn't a visually good fit. This is because
9.No. First it is important to note or recal what integers are, there are negative or positive whole number . 
10. The consistency criteria required to define probability are as follows:
+ (I)Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers.  
+ (II) Qualitative correspondence with common sense.  
+ (III) Consistency.  
11. Equivalence of the numbers below:
  + 1 is 
12. Yes.Real numbers are represented in computers using floating-point arithmetic, but due to finite precision and rounding errors, they are only approximations. Certain real numbers can't be exactly represented, and this can lead to inaccuracies.
13.  The logical implication, deniocal, equilvance question:
    
14.  The basic difference between git and github is that Git is a version control system for tracking code changes locally, while GitHub is a cloud platform for hosting Git repositories and enabling collaboration with additional tools like issue tracking and code reviews.
15. Bayesian school of thought / probability theory.  
16. Bayesian probability theory is most useful when data is scarce, as it allows the use of prior knowledge to make inferences. 
17. The frequentist school of thought cannot define or discuss the probability of existence of God, , as it relies on observable frequencies and empirical data, not metaphysical or philosophical concepts.  
18. For the Kernel density graph, the visualisation is completely wrong, because it depicts a certain population/person is below the age of 0 which is not poosible as nature implies. No one born on earth as for certain can be o years old. Hence I can concude the visualisation is wrong.     
19. Everything in computers is represented by integers because computers use binary (0s and 1s) to store data, and integers are the most efficient way to represent binary values.  
20. The ancestor programming language of C is B, developed in the 1960s.  
21. The first high-level programming language is Fortran, developed in the 1950s for scientific and engineering calculation.
22. Answer:
23. Answer:
24. The deductive reasoning ang plausible reasoning.  
For deductive reasoning:  
+ Premise 1: All mammals have a backbone.  
+ Premise 2: A man is a mammal  
+ Conclusion: Therefore, a man has a backbone.  
The Plausible reasoning:  
+ Observation 1: The sun has risen in the east every day for thousands of years.  
+ Observation 2: Today the sun is rising in the east.  
+ Conclusion: Therefore, the sun will rise in the east tomorrow.
25.Two Boolean propositions are equal if they have the same truth value for all possible inputs. This means their truth tables are identical, and for every combination of truth values for the variables, both propositions will yield the same result.
