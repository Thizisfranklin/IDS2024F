1. The main difference lies in the fact that observational data is an approximation of reality, shaped by our methods, tools, and perspectives,and it can subject to biases and error, while reality itself is the full, objective truth, which may not always be fully captured by our observations due to limitations.
2. In data visualization, Aesthetics are visual elements that help communicate the data effectively which make the data more understandable and insightful. In data science they may include as color, size, shape, position, line style, text, and more.  From my understanding, the car=reful selection and combination of these aesthetics help make data easier to understand, more engaging, and clearer for the viewer.  
3. The second color pallete and this is the individuals colors are very didtinct from each other, hence it will be nore effective in visualisation.
4. the following are the color scales as depicted the questions:  
   + Qualitative color scale 
   + Sequential color scale
   + Diverging color scale
   + Accent color scale 
5 . The following statements are valid:
6. The three pillars of science are Theory, experiment, and computation+data
7. No logical implication does not imply physical caustaion.As one night imply.Example: (logical implication does not necessarily imply physical causation)
A: "It is raining."
B: "The streets are/ is wet "
A ⇒ B: "If it is raining, then the streets are wet."This is logically true in many common situations, because when it rains, the streets often get wet. Rain is a common cause of wet streets.
B ⇒ A: "If the streets are wet, then it must be raining." This is not necessarily true. The streets could be wet for reasons other than rain. Hence The wetness of the streets (B) could have many causes besides rain (A), such as washing the streets, a burst water pipe, or any number of other factors. While A ⇒ B might hold logically (because rain often leads to wet streets), it doesn’t imply that A (rain) is the cause of B (wet streets), as there are many other potential causes for the wetness. This shows that logical implication does not always equate to physical causation.
8. a) It isn't a visually good fit. This is because
9.No. First it is important to note or recal what integers are, there are negative or positive whole number . 
10. The consistency criteria required to define probability are as follows:
+ (I)Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers.  
+ (II) Qualitative correspondence with common sense.  
+ (III) Consistency.  
11. Equivalence of the numbers below:
  + 1 is 
12. Yes.Real numbers are represented in computers using floating-point arithmetic, but due to finite precision and rounding errors, they are only approximations. Certain real numbers can't be exactly represented, and this can lead to inaccuracies.
13.  The logical implication, deniocal, equilvance question:  
14.  The basic difference between git and github
15. Bayesian school of thought
16. When data is scarce the classical schol of thought
