1)  The three pillars of science are, experiment, and theory/ theoretical model, computation + Data
2)  Predictive computing: In many fields, especially in physics, chemistry, and biology, direct experimentation may be impossible or impractical due to ethical, logistical, or cost constraints. Computational simulations can replace physical experiments by modeling complex systems digitally and simulating their behaviors. Hence, allowing scientists to predict outcomes without needing to conduct expensive or harmful physical experiments. They also provide insights into phenomena that are difficult to observe directly (e.g., the behavior of distant galaxies or the microscopic interactions of molecules).
Numerical Simulation: Ity can be used substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available for e.g in astronomy, instead of relying solely on telescope observations, computational analysis of datasets from space telescopes can help discover new planets, analyze cosmic phenomena, or predict celestial events.
Data driven via machine learning: this as a substitute to theory if not available. E.g, it can substitute traditional financial theories (like the Efficient Market Hypothesis) because it doesn't rely on assumptions about the market being "efficient" or "rational." Instead, it uses historical data to learn patterns and make predictions. I think those models ( machine learning models) are more flexible and adaptive, and they often outperform traditional models, especially in complex and dynamic systems like financial markets.
3) The deductive reasoning ang plausible reasoning.  
   For deductive reasoning:  
+   Premise 1: All mammals have a backbone.  
+    Premise 2: A man is a mammal  
+    Conclusion: Therefore, a man has a backbone.  
   The Plausible reasoning:  
+    Observation 1: The sun has risen in the east every day for thousands of years.
+    Observation 2: Today the sun is rising in the east.
+    Conclusion: Therefore, the sun will rise in the east tomorrow.  
4)  The main difference lies in the fact that observational data is an approximation of reality, shaped by our methods, tools, and perspectives,and it can subject to biases and error, while reality itself is the full, objective truth, which may not always be fully captured by our observations due to limitations.
5) The pyramid moves from observation (gathering data), to model construction, calibration and validation and finally to prediction (testing that explanation).    
6) Logical proposition is a statement that can be either true or false; it must be one or the other, and it cannot be both.
7) In deductive reasoning, a logical proposition cannot simultaneously be both true and false. This is because deductive reasoning adheres to the principle of non-contradiction, which asserts that contradictory statements cannot both be true at the same time. A proposition is either true or false, and the validity of a deductive argument relies on this consistency  
**Example**  
+  Premise 1: All mammals have a heart.
+  Premise 2: A dog is a mammal.
+  Conclusion: Therefore, a dog has a heart.  
  8) No it doesn't necessitate that since A⇒B therefore B⇒A.    
    **Example**:
   +  A: "A tree has green leaves". "B: "It is spring or summer."  A ⇒ B (If a tree has green leaves, it's likely spring or summer) is generally true, but B ⇒ A (If it is spring or summer, the tree must have green leaves) is not always true. This example shows that A ⇒ B does not necessarily imply B ⇒ A because not all trees will have green leaves in the spring or summer due to various factors like evergreen species or environmental condition.   
9) **Example**: (logical implication does not necessarily imply physical causation)
+ A: "A tree has green leaves."  
+ B: "It is spring or summer"  
+ A ⇒ B: "If it is raining, then the streets are wet."This is logically true in many common situations, because when it rains, the streets often get wet. Rain is a common cause of wet streets.
+ B ⇒ A: "If the streets are wet, then it must be raining."
This is not necessarily true. The streets could be wet for reasons other than rain. Hence The wetness of the streets (B) could have many causes besides rain (A), such as washing the streets, a burst water pipe, or any number of other factors. While A ⇒ B might hold logically (because rain often leads to wet streets), it doesn’t imply that A (rain) is the cause of B (wet streets), as there are many other potential causes for the wetness. This shows that logical implication does not always equate to physical causation.  
10) The policeman uses deductive reasoning to conclude that the man is dishonest. Here's the reasoning process in simple if-then statements:  
  A ⇒ B ,  B ⇒ C , C ⇒ D
+ If the jewelry store window is broken (A), then the burglar alarm goes off (B).
+ If the burglar alarm goes off (B), then a masked man crawls out carrying a bag of jewelry (C).
+ If the masked man is crawling out with a bag of jewelry (C), then he is dishonest (D).
+ By linking these premises, the policeman concludes that the man is dishonest (D), based on the observed evidence that the man came out of the broken window with stolen jewelry. Therefore, by transitive reasoning (if A ⇒ B, and B ⇒ C, and C ⇒ D), the policeman concludes that D (the man is dishonest). This reasoning follows a chain of inferences based on observed evidence. Each step in the chain leads to the next, and ultimately, the policeman concludes that the man is a burglar.  
11) The tiniest unit of information is the bit  
12) A bit represents the smallest possible amount of information because it has only two possible values, making it the most basic form of data  
13) Boxes question:  
+ 1 bit = 2 different states.
+ 2 bits = 4 different states.
+ 3 bits = 8 different states.
