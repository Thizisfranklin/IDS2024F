1)  The three pillars of science are, experiment, and theory/ theoretical model, computation + Data

3) The deductive reasoning ang plausible reasoning.  
   For deductive reasoning:  
+   Premise 1: All mammals have a backbone.  
+    Premise 2: A man is a mammal  
+    Conclusion: Therefore, a man has a backbone.  
   The Plausible reasoning:  
+    Observation 1: The sun has risen in the east every day for thousands of years.
+    Observation 2: Today the sun is rising in the east.
+    Conclusion: Therefore, the sun will rise in the east tomorrow.  
4)  The main difference lies in the fact that observational data is an approximation of reality, shaped by our methods, tools, and perspectives,and it can subject to biases and error, while reality itself is the full, objective truth, which may not always be fully captured by our observations due to limitations.
5) The pyramid moves from observation (gathering data), to model construction, calibration and validation and finally to prediction (testing that explanation).    
6) Logical proposition is a statement that can be either true or false; it must be one or the other, and it cannot be both.
7) In deductive reasoning, a logical proposition cannot simultaneously be both true and false. This is because deductive reasoning adheres to the principle of non-contradiction, which asserts that contradictory statements cannot both be true at the same time. A proposition is either true or false, and the validity of a deductive argument relies on this consistency
+  Premise 1: All mammals have a heart.
+  Premise 2: A dog is a mammal.
+  Conclusion: Therefore, a dog has a heart.  
  8) No logical implication isn't same as physical causation. As implication is directly related/proportional to causation.  
    **Example**:
   +  A: "A tree has green leaves". "B: "It is spring or summer."  A ⇒ B (If a tree has green leaves, it's likely spring or summer) is generally true, but B ⇒ A (If it is spring or summer, the tree must have green leaves) is not always true. This example shows that A ⇒ B does not necessarily imply B ⇒ A because not all trees will have green leaves in the spring or summer due to various factors like evergreen species or environmental condition.   
9) **Example**:
+ A: "A tree has green leaves."  
+ B: "It is spring or summer"  
+ A ⇒ B: "If it is raining, then the streets are wet."This is logically true in many common situations, because when it rains, the streets often get wet. Rain is a common cause of wet streets.
+ B ⇒ A: "If the streets are wet, then it must be raining."
This is not necessarily true. The streets could be wet for reasons other than rain. Hence The wetness of the streets (B) could have many causes besides rain (A), such as washing the streets, a burst water pipe, or any number of other factors. While A ⇒ B might hold logically (because rain often leads to wet streets), it doesn’t imply that A (rain) is the cause of B (wet streets), as there are many other potential causes for the wetness. This shows that logical implication does not always equate to physical causation.  
10) The policeman uses deductive reasoning to conclude that the man is dishonest. Here's the reasoning process in simple if-then statements:  
  A ⇒ B ,  B ⇒ C , C ⇒ D
+ If the jewelry store window is broken (A), then the burglar alarm goes off (B).
+ If the burglar alarm goes off (B), then a masked man crawls out carrying a bag of jewelry (C).
+ If the masked man is crawling out with a bag of jewelry (C), then he is dishonest (D).
+ By linking these premises, the policeman concludes that the man is dishonest (D), based on the observed evidence that the man came out of the broken window with stolen jewelry. Therefore, by transitive reasoning (if A ⇒ B, and B ⇒ C, and C ⇒ D), the policeman concludes that D (the man is dishonest). This reasoning follows a chain of inferences based on observed evidence. Each step in the chain leads to the next, and ultimately, the policeman concludes that the man is a burglar.
