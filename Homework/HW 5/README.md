3) In data visualization, Aesthetics are visual elements that help communicate the data effectively which make the data more understandable and insightful. In data science they may include as color, size, shape, position, line style, text, and more. The careful selection and combination of these aesthetics help make data easier to understand, more engaging, and clearer for the viewer.  
4) Continuous And Discrete Aesthetics      
5) Quantitative (Numerical) Data:  
Description: Data that can be measured and quantified numerically. It has meaningful arithmetic properties, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
Example: Height of individuals (e.g., 160 cm, 175 cm) or temperature (e.g. 30Â°C).
Qualitative (Categorical) Data:  
Description: Data that represents categories or labels without any inherent numeric value. It can describe qualities or characteristics but cannot be measured in a numerical sense.  
Example: Eye color (e.g., blue, brown, green) or city names (e.g., New York, London, Tokyo).  
6) Factors 
7) Ordered Data (Ordinal Data):  
Description: Data where the categories have a meaningful order or ranking, but the differences between the categories are not necessarily consistent or measurable.
Example: Survey ratings (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent) or Education level (e.g., High School, Bachelor's, Master's, Ph.D.).
Unordered Data (Nominal Data):  
Description: Data where the categories do not have any inherent order or ranking. The values are simply different from one another.  
Example: Gender (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary) or Fruit types (e.g., Apple, Banana, Cherry)

10) Income Distribution: In economics, income data often has a long right tail, with most people earning below the median, and a few people earning significantly more. Using a logarithmic transformation on the income axis helps to make the income distribution more comparable and readable.

+ Quanlitative color scale: a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map  
+ Sequential color scale: can be used to represent data values, such as temperature , income , populaution  
+ Accent color scale: this is used to highlight specific element in a data.  
+ Diverging color scale: thi is ude to visualise a deviation in one of two directions relative to the neutral point
13) When look at the graph it shows a density or population is below 0 years which is absolutely not realistic, so the data is really bad and bears a wrong representation of population density.

16) Classical Probability : probability as a ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.  
Bayesian Probability : probability as a degree of belief or confidence  
Frequentist Probability : Probability as the long-term frequency of an event occurring  
Propensity: focuses on the tendency or disposition of a system to produce a particular outcome under certain conditions, rather than on frequency or personal belief.
