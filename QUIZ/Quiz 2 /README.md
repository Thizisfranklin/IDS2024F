1) What is the fastest component of a computer memory? the register  
2) Why is modern computer memory comprised of a multilevel (hierarchical) structure? Modern computer memory is hierarchical to balance speed and cost, allowing quick access to frequently used data while providing larger storage for less critical information.  
3) What is the slowest kind of computer storage device? Disk
4) Name the hierarchy of the memory of modern computers, from the smallest to the largest memory size? Answer: the register, the L1 cache, the L2 cache, the L3 cache , DRam, Disk.  
5) What is smallest unit of information in computers?  Answer: Bit  
7) Why have humans chosen the binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent data in computers? Humans chose binary because it is simple and reliable for electronic systems, representing two states (on/off) which are easier to implement with physical components.  
8) What is the typical speed of contemporary computer memory registers? the registers are  typically less than 0 nanoseconds (ns)   
9) What decade was the first digital computer built? it was built  in the 1940s ( Particularily in 1945 that's ENIAC)  
10) What is a fixed program computer? this is unique type of computer that have programs permanently wired in it.    

11) Name an example of modern-day fixed program computer? Calculator    

12) What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge? Declarative knowledge describes facts or concepts (what something is), while imperative knowledge involves commands or actions (what to do).     
13) Classify the following statements as imperative or declarative knowledge.    
a. The letter B is the second letter in the English alphabet Answer: this is delcarative knpowledge.    
b. Overcast sky conditions are more likely to cause rain. Answer: this is declarative knowledge.    
c. Submit your answer to this question in subfolder 2 of quiz folder of your GitHub project Answer: this is impertive knowledsge  
e. Once done with this quiz, do not forget to commit your responses to your repository.Anwser: This is imperative knowledge.   
d. You must answer all questions in this quiz to get a full grade. Answer: imperative knowledge.  

14) What class of human knowledge algorithms belong to? imperative /procedural knowledge    

15) What is the name of the first digital computer?  The ENIAC  

16) Name a computer programming language whose evolution and popularity is tightly coupled with the field of Bioinformatics?> Answer: Python 

17) Name a computer programming language whose evolution and popularity is tightly coupled with the field of Numerical Computing, Atmospheric Science, Plasma Sciences, and Aerospace Engineering, among others Answer: Fortan   

18) Name the five major components of a modern digital computer ? CPU (Central Processing Unit) , Memory (RAM), Storage (HDD/SSD),Input Devices, and Output Devices. 

19) Name an example of fixed-program computer ? Abacus 

20) Order the following languages chronologically according to their birth date. (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes)
Java, COBOL, C++, Python, Fortran, B: Answer:  B → Fortran → COBOL → C → C++ → Java → Python

21) (A) What is the closest human-readable programming language to machine code (i.e., binary numbers)?  Assembly Language

(B) Does it need interpretation in order to become machine-comprehensible?  Yes, it needs an assembler to convert to machine code.  


22) (A) Name the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use?  Fortan 

(B) Approximately how many decades is it old? Approximately seven decades old (it was created in the 1950s).

23) (A) Name a second-generation programming language? Assembly Language  

(B) Which language-generation are Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, R?  Fortran: 3rd generation, C: 3rd generation, C++: 4th generation, MATLAB: 4th generation, Python: 4th generation, R: 4th generation   

24) In what decades C, C++, MATLAB, and Python were created, respectively? C: 1970s, C++: 1980s, MATLAB: 1980s , Python: 1990s

25) Name an ancestor programming language of C : B is an ancestor of C.

26) Name a programming language ancestor of C++ : C is the ancestor of C++.

27) Name a programming language ancestor of MATLAB and a programming language ancestor of Python? MATLAB: Fortran, Python: ABC  
  
28) How do you define logarithm? Explain with a simple example just as we did in class?: A logarithm is the power to which a number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number. Log base 2 of 8 is 3( because 2 raised to power 3 is 8 )  
29) Summation problem:  
the value of S = 3 + 6 + 9 + ... + 99( Arithmetic Series)
First term a = 3 , common diff. d, = 3, last term, l = 99 , then n ( number of terms)  = ((99-3)/3) + 1 =333 , Sum , S = n/2 * ( a+l) = 1683

## Extra Credit:
30) Magnetic tapes generally last longer than HDDs. Magnetic tapes can last up to 30 years, while HDDs typically last around 5-10 years.  
31) An abacus existed long before digital computers.
