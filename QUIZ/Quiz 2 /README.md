What is the fastest component of a computer memory? the register  
Why is modern computer memory comprised of a multilevel (hierarchical) structure? Modern computer memory is hierarchical to balance speed and cost, allowing quick access to frequently used data while providing larger storage for less critical information.  
What is the slowest kind of computer storage device? Disk
Name the hierarchy of the memory of modern computers, from the smallest to the largest memory size? Answer: the register, the L1 cache, the L2 cache, the L3 cache , DRam, Disk.  
What is smallest unit of information in computers?  Answer: Bit  
Why have humans chosen the binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent data in computers? Humans chose binary because it is simple and reliable for electronic systems, representing two states (on/off) which are easier to implement with physical components.  
What is the typical speed of contemporary computer memory registers? the registers are  typically less than 0 nanoseconds (ns)   
What decade was the first digital computer built? it was built  in the 1940s ( Particularily in 1945 that's ENIAC)  
What is a fixed program computer? this is unique type of computer that have programs permanently wired in it.    

Name an example of modern-day fixed program computer? Calculator    

What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge? Declarative knowledge describes facts or concepts (what something is), while imperative knowledge involves commands or actions (what to do).

How do you define logarithm? Explain with a simple example just as we did in class?: A logarithm is the power to which a number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number. Log base 2 of 8 is 3( because 2 raised to power 3 is 8 )  

## Extra Credit:
Magnetic tapes generally last longer than HDDs. Magnetic tapes can last up to 30 years, while HDDs typically last around 5-10 years.  
An abacus existed long before digital computers.
