1) The three pillars of science are obersavtion, experiment, and theory/ theoretical model
2) The third piilar here being theory.
3) Logical reasoniong categories: Plausible reasoning and deductive reasoning   
 Plausible reasoning:   
  **Example**
+ Observation 1: The sun has risen in the east every day for thousands of years.
+ Observation 2: Today the sun is rising in the east.
+ Conclusion: Therefore, the sun will rise in the east tomorrow.  
      Deductive reasoning:  
    **Example**
    + Premise 1:  All humans have teeth 
    + Premise 2 : Franklin is a human  
    + Conclusion: Therefore, Franklin has a teeth    
  4) The main difference lies in the fact that observational data is an approximation of reality, shaped by our methods, tools, and perspectives,and it can subject to biases and error, while reality itself is the full, objective truth, which may not always be fully captured by our observations due to limitations.
+  Can we then observe reality? No
  5)  From my understanding, Model validation is  simply about checking how well the model performs with new data (it answers, "Does the model work for data it hasn't seen before?").
Model calibration is about adjusting the model's parameters to make its predictions more accurate (it answers, "How can we fine-tune the model to better match observed outcomes?").



6) Logical implication is completely different from physical causation. As implication is directly related/proportional to causation.   
    **Example**:
   +  A: "A tree has green leaves". "B: "It is spring or summer."  A ⇒ B (If a tree has green leaves, it's likely spring or summer) is generally true, but B ⇒ A (If it is spring or summer, the tree must have green leaves) is not always true. This example shows that A ⇒ B does not necessarily imply B ⇒ A because not all trees will have green leaves in the spring or summer due to various factors like evergreen species or environmental condition
