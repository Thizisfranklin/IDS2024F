1)
+ Observation: Identifying a phenomenon or problem.  
+ Formulating a Hypothesis: Proposing a tentative explanation or prediction.  
+ Designing an Experiment: Creating an experimental setup to test the hypothesis.  
+ Model Calibaration: adjusting the model's parameters to make its predictions more accurate   
+ Model validation: Ensuring the results are reliable through replication.  
+ Prediction: Use knoweldge from results to make possible prediction about natural phenomenon.  
2) The three pillars of science are, experiment, and theory/ theoretical model, computation + Data
3) The third pillar, which involves computational and data science, plays a crucial role in modern science by replacing or enhancing traditional methods of empirical observation and theory/modeling. With the rise of computational power, and big data analytics scientists can simulate, predict, and analyze at scales that were previously unimaginable, revolutionizing the way scientific knowledge is acquired and applied across fields.  
  **Examples**
  + Predictive computing: In many fields, especially in physics, chemistry, and biology, direct experimentation may be impossible or impractical due to ethical, logistical, or cost constraints. Computational simulations can replace physical experiments by modeling complex systems digitally and simulating their behaviors. Hence, allowing scientists to predict outcomes without needing to conduct expensive or harmful physical experiments. They also provide insights into phenomena that are difficult to observe directly (e.g., the behavior of distant galaxies or the microscopic interactions of molecules).
  + Numerical Simulation:  Ity can be used substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available for e.g in astronomy, instead of relying solely on telescope observations, computational analysis of datasets from space telescopes can help discover new planets, analyze cosmic phenomena, or predict celestial events.
  + Data driven via machine learning: this as a substitute to theory if not available. E.g, it can substitute traditional financial theories (like the Efficient Market Hypothesis) because it doesn't rely on assumptions about the market being "efficient" or "rational." Instead, it uses historical data to learn patterns and make predictions. I think those models ( machine learning models) are more flexible and adaptive, and they often outperform traditional models, especially in complex and dynamic systems like financial markets.  
4) Logical reasoniong categories: Plausible reasoning and deductive reasoning   
 Plausible reasoning:   
  **Example**
+ Observation 1: The sun has risen in the east every day for thousands of years.
+ Observation 2: Today the sun is rising in the east.
+ Conclusion: Therefore, the sun will rise in the east tomorrow.  
      Deductive reasoning:  
    **Example**:
    + Premise 1:  All humans have teeth 
    + Premise 2 : Franklin is a human  
    + Conclusion: Therefore, Franklin has a teeth    
 5)  The main difference lies in the fact that observational data is an approximation of reality, shaped by our methods, tools, and perspectives,and it can subject to biases and error, while reality itself is the full, objective truth, which may not always be fully captured by our observations due to limitations.
+  Can we then observe reality? No. Personally,  Think we cannot directly observe reality in its entirety. Our perception of reality is always mediated by senses, tools, and theories. What we observe is typically a specific aspect of reality  but models in general help us perecieve what we assume to be real. Example is quantum particles. 
  6)  From my understanding, Model validation is  simply about checking how well the model performs with new data (it answers, "Does the model work for data it hasn't seen before?").
Model calibration is about adjusting the model's parameters to make its predictions more accurate (it answers, "How can we fine-tune the model to better match observed outcomes?").



7) Logical implication is completely different from physical causation. As implication is directly related/proportional to causation.   
    **Example**:
   +  A: "A tree has green leaves". "B: "It is spring or summer."  A ⇒ B (If a tree has green leaves, it's likely spring or summer) is generally true, but B ⇒ A (If it is spring or summer, the tree must have green leaves) is not always true. This example shows that A ⇒ B does not necessarily imply B ⇒ A because not all trees will have green leaves in the spring or summer due to various factors like evergreen species or environmental condition
 8)  George Boole (An English mathematician, philosopher, and logician)
 9)  Two Boolean propositions are considered equal if they always have the same truth value for all possible values of their variables. In other words, the two propositions are logically equivalent.
 10)  When you add two propositions that complement each other, the result is always true because one of the two will always be true.  
    **Example**:   
 +   Traffic Light Scenario: traffic light controlling the flow of traffic at an intersection. The light can either be Green (allowing cars to go) or Red (stopping cars)
 +   Proposition A: The traffic light is Green.
 +   Proposition B: The traffic light is Red.  ( here or is used to esbtalish the complementary factor between the two propositions)
 +   In this case, the OR operation tells us that the traffic light is always in one of two states — it is either Green (A) or it is Red(B). There is no other option. In the real world, this reflects the fact that a traffic light can only be in one of two possible states at any given time (Green or Red), so one of these two propositions must always be true.  
  11)  The conjunction of two propositions means that both propositions must be true at the same time for the result to be true.
     **Example**
Scenario: Weather Conditions and Umbrella. I am deciding whether to carry an umbrella based on the weather. I have two complementary propositions:
+ Proposition A: It is raining.
+ Proposition B: It is not raining.
+ Both A and B are complementary and the conjunction of the two means that both conditions would have to be true simultaneously. But this is impossible because it cannot both be raining and not raining at the same time. Therefore, the result is always false.  
12) Bit is the tiniest unit of information.   
13) A completely empty universe would contain no information.  
14) 4 bits can represent 16 different states (or integers).  
15) 4 boxes, each with 3 possible values (−1, 0, +1), can represent 81 different states.
