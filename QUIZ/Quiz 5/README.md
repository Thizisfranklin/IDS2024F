1) Reading form: This can be translated to the probability of event A given event B ( a conditional probability of A occurring given that B has already occurred)
2) + Classical Probability
   + Bayesian Probability
   + Frequentist Probability
   + Propensity Probability
3) Bayesian Probability
4) Frequentist Probability
5) Bayesian probability allows for the inclusion of subjective probability assessments. Since the existence of God is a matter of belief rather than empirical evidence, Bayesian probability allows one to quantify the belief in the existence of God based on personal or expert judgment.
6) No. Bayesian Probability isn't a subset of frequentisit interference, although both approaches use statistical inference. This is because Bayesian Inference treats probabilities as distributions that update as new data is acquired. This allows Bayesian methods to incorporate prior knowledge and beliefs, while Frequentist methods do not. Hence I conclude it is not a subset of frequntist inference which focuses on a long frequency of events, treating probabilities as fixed values.
7) Bayesian inference
8) This is simply because Bayesian allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge or theories, which is useful in fields with complex models and where experiments cannot always be repeated. In contrast, Frequentist Probability relies on repeated trials or long-term frequencies, which might not always be feasible in the fields like physics and engineering.
9) It appeared in the 17th century 
10) + Aleatory Uncertainty: Due to inherent randomness or variability in the system (e.g., rolling a die).
    + Epistemic Uncertainty: Due to lack of knowledge or imperfect information (e.g., uncertainty about the precise values of parameters in a model).
11) The uncertainty there is epistemic uncertainty. This is because the uncertainty arises from a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of what was actually seen.
12) They visual elements that help communicate the data effectively such as like color, shape, size,e.t.c. which make the data more understandable and insightful.
13) Asetheticsare of two types, which are discrete and continuous data asethetics 
14) + Factors are the variables or independent variables in an experiment that are manipulated (e.g., "temperature" ).
    + Levels are the different values or categories that a factor can take (e.g., "high" temperature).
15) the continous data value and the discrete data value. forthge discrete data value examples are the whole number like 1,2 and for the continous data values we ahve like numbers we decimals like 1.01, 1.002, e.t.c
16) Variable holding data are commonly called factors. 
17) Examples: Ordered data - Grade for the semester, while unorderd data is the names of people in the class 
18) Color scales: qualitative, quantitative, sequential, accent color scale, and diverging color scale.
    + Quanlitative color scale:  a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map
    + Sequential color scale: can be used to represent data values, such as temperature , income , populaution
    + Accent color scale: this is used to highlight specific element in a data.
    + Diverging color scale: thi is ude to visualise a deviation in one of two directions relative to the neutral point
 19)  Professional data scientist avoid 3-D data visualization, tend to avoid 3D plots because they can be difficult to interpret accurate and create misleading visualizations. It will be difficult to communicate the data to one's audience. 
 20) My example using zipcode: example illustrates how zip codes could be either numerical or categorical depending on how they are used in analysis:
If zip codes are used for counting, ranking, or calculating distances, they can be treated as numerical data.
If zip codes are used to group or classify data by geographical regions, they are treated as categorical data.
The context and the type of analysis dictate whether a dataset is classified as numerical or categorical.
 21) Color can be either categorical/unordered or quantitative/ordered, depending on how it is used in data visualization. Color is categorical/unordered when it is used to differentiate distinct groups or categories. Color is quantitative/ordered when it represents a range of values that have a natural order or scale.
 22)  THe second diagram e1 and e2 diagram 
 23) The best visualising color is the first color pallete as the colors are distinct from each other  
 24) US cities Temperatures
     + Chicago
     + Death Valley
     + San Diego
     + Death Valley
25) The Color scales are as follows;  for a) Qualitative for b) Sequential for c) Diverging for d) Accent color scale
26) Polar coordinates are ideal when your data naturally involves angles or periodic, repeating patterns.
27) Accent color scale was used
28) The graph is ugly because of inappropiate representation the movies sales should be on the y axis while the salesshould be on the x -axis which will account fora better representation and the scales will look more in hierarchy and appealying the numbers of scale will then fit correctly with each represented bar plot.
29) a) The temperature will increase
    b) In 2050, Earth's temperature will be projected to be approximately 1.0 to 1.5°C (1.8 to 2.7°F) warmer than the average temperature during the period 1951-1980.
