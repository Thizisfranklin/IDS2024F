1) Reading form: The value of Pi provided that A exist as B is given 
2) + Classical Probability
   + Bayesian Probability
   + Frequentist Probability
   + Propensity Probability
3) Bayesian Probability
4) Frequentist Probability
5) Classical Probability among all allowed the definiotion on the existence of God, this is because their school of thought was based on the degree of belief
6) No. Bayesian Probability isn't a subset of frequentisit interference, although both approaches use statistical inference, they rely on different philosophical perspectives on probability and modeling. Bayesian inference conditions on the observed data, while frequentist inference does not.
7) Bayesian inference
8) This is simply because of how easily experiements can be conducted
9) It appeared 1974
10) THe uncertainty that exist in our experiments are aleotric
11) The uncertainty there is aleotric
12) All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics
13) The two tpyes are the discrete and continuous data values asethetics 
14) factors and levels are differents
15) the continous data value and the discrete data value. forthge discrete data value examples are the whole number like 1,2 and for the continous data values we ahve like numbers we decimals like 1.01, 1.002, e.t.c
16) VAriable holding data a re commonly called Variables.
17) Examples: Ordered data - Grade for the semester, while unorderd data is the names of people in the class 
18) Color scales: qualitative, quantitative, sequential, accent color scale, and diverging color scale.
    + Qualitative color scale:  a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order , such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product.
    + Quantitative color scale:  a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map
    + Sequential color scale: can be used to represent data values, such as temperature , income , populaution
    + Accent color scale: this is used to highlight specific element in a data.
    + Divging color scale: thi is ude to visualise a deviation in one of two directions relative to the neutral point
 19)  Professional data scientist avoid 3d dat becuase it be difficlt to understand and illustrate to their audience
 20)
